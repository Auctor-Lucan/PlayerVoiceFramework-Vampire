# PlayerVoiceEvents

This is basically my first SkyrimSE Mod, and something like my wet dream.
This Repo will be way more up-to-date than the Official Mod-Page, however it will require you to build both the
SKSE-Plugin, and to compile the Papyrus-Scripts.

See the Mod-Page at [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143616)

This Mod is essentially a modern replacement for both PCHT and Dragonborn Voice-Barks. It allows for way more
customization, with way less issues.

### Requirements:

- SKSE - This mod is like 99% Based on SKSE. Requirement should be obvious...
