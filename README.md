# Player Voice Framework

## NOTE: I'm currently in the process of re-writing the entire mod. The whole process is done on the rewrite branch and will be pushed to the master once it's in a stable state.

This is basically my first SkyrimSE Mod, and something like my wet dream.
This Repo will be way more up-to-date than the Official Mod-Page, however it will require you to build both the
SKSE-Plugin, and to compile the Papyrus-Scripts.

See the Mod-Page at [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143616)

This Framework is essentially a modern replacement for both PCHT and Dragonborn Voice-Barks. It allows for way more
customization, with way less issues.

### Requirements:

- SKSE - The Framework is written in C++, and SKSE-Plugins are the easiest way to inject C++ Code into Skyrim.
- Address Library - The Framework uses the CommonLibSSE-NG Helper-Library. This requires Address Library to be installed so it can work on multiple Game-Versions.
- At least one Event-Pack - As of now this framework is still in development, so there obviously aren't any except [the default one](https://github.com/lunatic-gh/PVFDefaultEvents), which is also still in Development.
