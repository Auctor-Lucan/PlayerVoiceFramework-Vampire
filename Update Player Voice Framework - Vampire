# Player Voice Framework

This is a fork from Lunatic's Player Voice Framework. Playtesting an old version has shown it stable enough for a Nexus release in wait for the upcoming finilization of the mod. Please do not direct any questions or requests for support from Lunatic based on this fork of the project.
